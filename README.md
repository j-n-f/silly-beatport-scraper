# The Silly Beatport Scraper

For anyone who finds manual conversion of Beatport downloads from WAV to FLAC
(along with populating all the metadata by hand) to be tedious.

Beatport closed off their API, requiring users to request an API key (for which
they have to give a description of intended use, so that Beatport can decide if
they like how that affects their brand, or something like that).

I think this is rather silly.

This code is both a practical tool, and a means of protesting the futility of
their attempt to restrict access to data that's in plain sight (which will cost
them more in bandwidth, but given that they won't offer tagged FLAC, I don't
really feel so bad about that)
